**Installation**<br>
Anaconda Distribution has most of the libraries necessary for the analysis done.<br>
Progressbar needs to be installed. <br>

**Project Motivation**<br>
The project requires us to work on simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO(buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer. These pose challenge in analysing the data. The task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.

**Data Preparation**<br>
There are three datasets provided and each dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for further analysis. The target features for analysis are offer_success, percent_success.

**File Descriptions**

**Results**<br>
The detailed study, analysis and results of the analysis are summarized [here](https://medium.com/@balamurali91/starbucks-capstone-project-cba34279466c).
